## Objective of the Application:

The mobile application is designed for table reservations and food ordering in restaurants. It enables customers to book tables, place dine-in or delivery orders, and track them seamlessly. The system also includes dedicated modules for Waiters, Chefs, and Admins.
In addition, a web-based admin panel was developed to manage the restaurant, and the back-end, built with a REST API, handles communication with both the web and mobile applications.
